[`react-bootstrap-table-ng`](https://github.com/jeff-k-zhou/react-bootstrap-table-ng) is a fork of [`react-bootstrap-table2`](https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2) with some bug fixes and newer React and Bootstrap versions support.

> Due to the fact that [`react-bootstrap-table2`](https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2) is not maintained anymore (the last commit and release was on 2020-05-31, and it doesn't support React 18 and above), I forked it and created `react-bootstrap-table-ng` to continue its development. I am not a professional developer (high school student who will graduate in 2026), but I will try my best to maintain it.


[`react-bootstrap-table2`](https://github.com/react-bootstrap-table/react-bootstrap-table2) is next generation of [`react-bootstrap-table`](https://github.com/AllenFang/react-bootstrap-table). Allen Fang and his team rebuilt it to make it better and easier to use. Following is their mission:

* Refactor core module and make challenges possible
* More customizable table
* Reduce bugs and bundled size
* Solve performance issues
* Improve the [`remote`](https://allenfang.github.io/react-bootstrap-table/docs#remote) mode
* Improve handling of DOM events
* Support nested data
* Support table footer
